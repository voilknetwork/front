## To Do List
<span></span>
### <span id="Backup_your_password">1. Backup Your Password</span>

Unlike centralized web services, **it is not possible to recover lost passwords on the Voilk blockchain**.

You are entirely responsible for saving your password, backing it up and keeping it secure.

It is strongly recommended that you store an offline copy of your password somewhere safe in case of a hard drive failure or other calamity. Consider digital offline storage (such as a flash drive or burned CD), secure private cloud-based storage, as well as printed paper. Use multiple methods of storage for best redundancy. 

If your account is valuable, value it!

### <span id="Setup_your_Profile_Avatar_and_Cover_Image">4. Setup your Profile, Avatar, and Cover Image</span>

You can update your profile through the Settings page. This includes your display name, location, about information, and website.

To set your avatar image, enter a link to where the image is located into the "Profile Picture URL" field or use the "Upload an image" feature.

To set your cover image, enter a link to where the image is located into the "Cover Image URL" field or use the "Upload an image" feature.

Once you have made all your changes, click the "Update" button to save your profile.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Choose_your_NSFW_(Not_Safe_for_Work)_Display_Preference">5. Choose your "NSFW" (Not Safe for Work) Display Preference, Language, and Rewards</span>

By default, content that users have tagged as "NSFW" will be hidden, but a link will be shown to reveal the content. You can update your display preference so that NSFW content is always shown by default or is completely hidden with no option to reveal.

You can select the language you wish to display the website in. Currently, English, Spanish, Russian, French, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Polish and Chinese are available to choose from.

You can also choose how you will receive your Blog post rewards and Comment post rewards. It is recommended that you read the <a href="#Digital_Currencies">Digital Currencies</a> section first.

### <span id="Sign_Up_for_Voilk_Chat">6. Join Voilk General Chat</span>

### <span id="Create_your_introduceyourself_post">7. Create your "Introduceyourself" Post</span>

While not required, the tradition for new users is to create an "introduceyourself" post in order to let the community get to know you.

You can see some examples of what other people have done [here](https://voilk.com/trending/introduceyourself). Many users like to take a picture of themselves holding up a piece of paper that says "Voilknetwork" with the current date.

If you have other social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) you can help the community verify that you are who you say you are by sharing the link to your Voilk profile on them. If you are claiming to be someone famous, this is pretty much expected.

You will want to make your title attractive and relevant to your content. The first image that you use will become the thumbnail image.

You can insert images by dragging & dropping, pasting from the clipboard, or by selecting them.

Tags will help people find your posts. Each post can have up to five tags, separated by spaces. The tags should all be relevant to the content in the post. You can browse content by tags, as well as see a list of popular tags that other users have used in their posts [here](https://voilk.com/tags).  The first tag becomes the post's category and cannot be changed later.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Curation">Curation</span>

Up to 25% of the reward for each post goes to the people who upvoted on it. These people are called Curators.

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Payments">Payments</span>

Payouts are made 7 days after the post/comment is created. You can claim your rewards in your wallet after 7 days.

The projected payments may fluctuate (up and down) until the final payment amount is reached.

Payments for posts are split between the author (at least 75%) and the curators (up to 25%).

The author reward is paid 50% in Voilk Power and 50% in VOILK by default.

Authors also have the option to decline payout, or be paid in 100% Voilk Power!

### <span id="Reputation">Reputation</span>

A reputation score is one way that Voilknetwork measures the amount of value you have brought to the community.

The higher the reputation, the more upvotes the account received.

### <span id="Plagiarism">Plagiarism</span>

The community is looking for you to create engaging content. 

Plagiarising, which is posting someone else's material as if it were your own, is very frowned upon by the Voilk community.

If you are using anyone else's material as part of your posts (including images), even if it is free to use, please cite your sources. You should make sure that you are not violating any copyright laws if you are using someone else's material/images. Limited, sourced material sharing is OK under fair use and fair dealing doctrines.

Remember, your posts should have original content in them. Quotes should not compose an entire post. Include your own thoughts, photographs, art, and ideas. 

<a href="#Table_of_Contents">^</a>
### <span id="Password_Security">Password Security</span>

**It is not possible to recover lost passwords for Voilk accounts**. You are 100% responsible for having it backed up. This means secure digital backups, as well as secured paper backups, stored in different places if possible.

Never put your password into unverified third party websites as they may steal your account. 

Your Voilk account is worth real money. Treat your Voilk password like you would your bank password and keep it secure!
